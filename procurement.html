title: "Making city-to-city comparisons"
---

<p>One benefit of data standards is that they make it easier to conduct analyses and create visualizations comparing different cities to one another.</p>
<p>For this example, we have charts comparing procurement throughout months of the year in several cities. [This explanation needs fixing.] [Also: These charts are confusing and should probably be consolidated into one, and with clearer labels.]</p>
