title: "Mapping data across municipalities in a metro area"
---

<p>Many city challenges are actually region-wide challenges. Yet the lack of usage of standards for many datasets means that it is often time-consuming to do something as simple as making a map of a metropolitan area showing data seamlessly across jurisdictions. For this project, I created an example of a map showing business licenses for both Kansas City and Independence, Missouri:
<div id="mapid" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"></div>
<br>
<p>Of course, this concept isn’t limited to business licenses — in fact, that's probably not even the best use case, it's just the example used here. There could be regional maps of everything from 911 calls to building permits.</p>
<p>If you are wondering why there appear to be some locations outside of these two cities, it has to do with issues in the original data. [Let's double check this!]</p>
